          Our dear family and friends,
          <br>
          <br>
          We're getting married! We don’t want a big to-do but rather a gathering of our
          most cherished people for a weekend of unity, revelry and celebration of love.
          We've reserved a beautiful farm estate that has enough accommodation for 40
          people and we hope that you will stay with us for the full duration of the
          weekend.

          The entire farm estate has been reserved for all guests for the weekend of Friday February 1st to Sunday February 3rd. The actual wedding will take place on Saturday February 2nd, but we invite you to join us for a potluck dinner on Friday evening.

          Rietfontein Rd, Badfontein Valley,

          <span class="bold">Cost per guest for the weekend (breakfast included Saturday and Sunday):</span>
        </p>
        <ul class="left">
          <li>Rand: R 1,800</li>
          <li>Taiwan Dollars: NT 4,000</li>
          <li>US Dollars: $ 135</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="left">
          <span class="bold">Unfortunately the estate doesn't allow individual payments so all
           accommodation on the farm needs to be paid as a lump sum by
            the beginning of October.</span> There are 4 big houses available
             with a variety of double rooms, twin rooms and single rooms
              available. We will do our best to fit people into those
               rooms appropriately and sensibly (couples will naturally be
                given priority for double beds and privacy). Because there is
                   only space for 40 people, it will be allocated through a first
                    come, first served system. Please feel free to choose your
                     own accommodation separately but if you would like to
                      stay with us on the estate <span class="bold">you can see the payment options below.</span>

        <p class="left small-margin">
          Those coming from out of country; we will contact you individually to arrange transport for you to the venue. If anyone else would like to be included in those arrangements then feel free to contact us. Those of you choosing to find your own separate accommodation; we suggest that you find a place in Dullstroom and if you let us know in advance then we will provide a shuttle for you to and from the venue.

        <p class="left small-margin">
          The venue is about 30mins away from either of the two small towns that it sits between so we’ve made some efforts to make sure that everyone is provided for over the weekend:
          <br>
          <br>
          If you will be joining us for the meet-and-greet potluck on Friday night; just bring a small dish of anything that tickles your fancy. We will create a chat group at a later stage to coordinate these efforts.
          <br>
          <br>
          If you’re paying for accommodation at our venue, the owners will provide you with a breakfast on the Saturday and Sunday mornings.
          <br>
          <br>
          There will be a banquet dinner on Saturday night but we will provide snacks to tide you over from breakfast.
          <br>
          <br>
          There will be a cash bar available for the duration of weekend. We will request that they stock the bar with wine, beer and whiskey but if you have any personal preferences then feel free to let us know and we'll make sure they have it available. The owners will charge a corkage fee of R40 (USD3 NT90) per bottle.

          We are pretty nomadic people and can’t take any wedding
           gifts back to Taiwan with us. We will be moving
            from Taiwan to Europe next year and hopefully finding
             a place where we can settle down. This is not a traditional
              wedding and we don’t expect any gifts but if you feel
               compelled to give us some token of your blessings,
                we would appreciate help in funding that next chapter
                 of our lives.
